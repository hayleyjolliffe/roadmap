# Focus Areas & Core Values

This document outlines the core focus areas and values guiding all decisions, systems, and goals for 2025. These serve as a compass for prioritization, alignment, and reflection across all quarters.

## Core Values

These values are the non-negotiable principles that define who I want to be and how I want to show up in every area of life:

- **Autonomy** – I value the ability to make decisions for myself and craft a life on my own terms.
- **Self-Respect** – I act in alignment with my highest self and hold myself to the standards I believe in.
- **Contribution** – I strive to make a meaningful impact and help others through my work and relationships.
- **Stability** – I prioritize long-term security, systems, and consistency across all aspects of life.

## Focus Areas

These are the major life domains receiving intentional focus this year. Every major project, goal, and habit will be categorized under one or more of these areas.

| Focus Area       | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Work & Income** | Build multiple income sources: remote job, freelance work, business offerings |
| **Health & Fitness** | Achieve peak physical health through consistent fitness, nutrition, and wellness routines |
| **Relationships** | Strengthen existing relationships and make progress toward relocation to be with my partner |
| **Systems & Routines** | Build sustainable systems that support habits, journaling, planning, and growth |
| **Learning & Growth** | Learn my partner's language (B2 by Dec), upskill professionally, and deepen self-awareness |
| **Environment** | Create a space (local or abroad) that supports my energy, confidence, and independence |

## Usage

All projects, tasks, and habits will be tagged with their corresponding focus area(s) in:
- GitHub Projects board (via custom field)
- Journal and review templates
- Planning documents and reflections

This will help track progress holistically and ensure balanced attention is given to what matters most.
