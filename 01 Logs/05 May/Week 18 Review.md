## Reflect
- [x] ~~What went well this week?~~
    Keeping up with intentions and tasks went fairly well despite all the setbacks and unforeseen stuff.
- [x] ~~What didn't go well this week?~~
    Friday. Holy shit. Friday.  
	
	Of the expected/planned things, Duolingo didn't go as well as I would've liked it to. I won the Obsidian league and move up to Diamond tomorrow, but I didn't finish the units that I was hoping to.
- [x] ~~What feelings came up the most this week?~~
    Grief, anxiety, sadness. I anticipate this will be a recurring theme over the coming weeks as I process. Hoping to add happier recurring feelings.
- [x] ~~What can I do better next week?~~
    Communicate. Anything that didn't go well that WAS in my control likely could have been improved if I had communicated differently.
## Align
- [x] ~~Revisit [[00 Identity]]~~
- [x] ~~Revisit [[01 Goals]]~~
- [x] ~~Revisit the week's calendar~~
- [x] ~~Do I need to make changes to better align with my identity and goals?~~
	With work changing, I'll need to make an effort to monitor how it affects my health/fitness this week. I want to be doing more towards health-related goals, so I'll keep track of schedule changes to update my fitness strategy.
## Plan
- [x] ~~Can I eliminate any events for reduced stress?~~
      Can't eliminate anything involving people this week, but eliminated extra tasks I had control over. Keeping things VERY limited this week.
- [x] ~~Schedule deep work blocks~~
- [x] ~~Schedule workouts~~
- [x] ~~Schedule appointments, additional events~~
