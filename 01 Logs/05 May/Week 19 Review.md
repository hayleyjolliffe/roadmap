## Reflect
- [x] ~~What went well this week?~~
    It didn't feel like a lot went well this week. With everyone visiting and not being in my room, it was hard to stay focused and on-routine.
- [x] ~~What didn't go well this week?~~
	Pretty much nothing went well. I feel like I fell behind a lot.
- [x] ~~What feelings came up the most this week?~~
	Stress, if you can call that a feeling.
- [x] ~~What can I do better next week?~~
	Set better boundaries.
## Align
- [x] ~~Revisit [[00 Identity]]~~
- [x] ~~Revisit [[01 Goals]]~~
- [x] ~~Revisit the week's calendar~~
- [x] ~~Do I need to make changes to better align with my identity and goals?~~
	With all the changes at home and with work, I need to really focus on doing things **for myself** whenever possible. I have plans for myself, and I deserve to be able to see them through.
## Plan
- [x] ~~Can I eliminate any events for reduced stress?~~
	Not looking like I can eliminate anything this week. I'll have to be more mindful of how I use my remaining time.
- [x] ~~Schedule deep work blocks~~
	Already seeing unforeseen stuff coming up that can't be rescheduled. Will have to schedule bigger deep work blocks later in the week.
- [x] ~~Schedule workouts~~
- [x] ~~Schedule appointments, additional events~~
