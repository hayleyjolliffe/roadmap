## Tasks
> Additional tasks go here. These tasks are important, but not necessarily linked to a North Star goal. For example, doing laundry is an important task that needs to get done, but likely doesn't move the needle for a North Star goal.

## EOD Reflection
> At the end of the day, I spend time reflecting on these questions before planning out the next day. This way, I can make small changes to ensure I'm in alignment with my guiding principles and goals.
1. Did I finish what I set out to do today? If no, what roadblocks came up?
2. Did my actions align with my goals, values, and guiding principles?
3. What went well today? What didn't?
4. Is there anything I need to change moving forward?
5. What can I do better tomorrow?
