## Reflect
- [ ] Did I complete the goals I set out to achieve? If not, what prevented me from completing them?
- [ ] What went well this quarter?
- [ ] What didn't go well this quarter?
- [ ] What do I need to change or eliminate to do better next quarter?
## Align
- [ ] Revisit [[00 Identity]] and [[01 Goals]]
- [ ] Revisit my calendar. Did I make the most effective use of my time? If not, where can I improve moving forward?
- [ ] Are my goals still relevant and aligned with my core identity?
- [ ] Do I need to make changes to better align with my identity and goals?
## Plan
- [ ] What high-level goal(s) will I plan to achieve this quarter?
- [ ] What projects or subgoals will I plan to achieve each month? Add high-level/proposed deadlines to my calendar to begin mapping out the quarter.
- [ ] Are appointments, key dates, and events in my calendar?
- [ ] Can I eliminate anything for reduced stress and increased focus/clarity this quarter?
