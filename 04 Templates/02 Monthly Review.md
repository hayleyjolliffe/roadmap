## Reflect
- [ ] Did I complete the goals/subgoals I set out to achieve? If not, what prevented me from completing them?
- [ ] What went well this month?
- [ ] What didn't go well this month?
- [ ] What can I do better next month?
## Align
- [ ] Revisit [[00 Identity]] and [[01 Goals]]
- [ ] Revisit my calendar
- [ ] Are my goals still relevant and aligned with my core identity?
- [ ] Do I need to make changes to better align with my identity and goals?
## Plan
- [ ] Have any new goals or projects come up that need to be prioritized?
- [ ] Are appointments, key dates, and events in my calendar?
- [ ] Schedule high-level deadlines
- [ ] Can I eliminate anything for reduced stress?
