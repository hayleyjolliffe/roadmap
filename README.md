This system is a living document designed to evolve as I progress through 2025. It draws from the [GTD](https://gettingthingsdone.com), [Johnny Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com), and [Bullet Journal](https://bulletjournal.com) systems for an intuitive, minimalist approach to tracking progress and achieving goals.

The system contains my high-level goals and alignment checks for the year, and becomes more granular with quarterly, monthly, weekly, and daily breakdowns to measure progress.

## Guiding Principles

This system is designed with my personal guiding principles in mind:

- **Be aggressive when your decisions are reversible; be cautious when they are not.** (Thanks, [Ramp](https://engineering.ramp.com/post/engineering-principles)!)
- **Do more with less.**
- **Progress beats perfection. Default to action.**
- **Don't outsource your self-worth.**
- **If it's not helping your goals, it's hurting them.**

## Dependencies

I aim to prioritize file ownership wherever possible, and minimize my dependence on proprietary technology and filetypes. This roadmap is comprised of Markdown files exclusively, which I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to view and edit.

I've opted to document my roadmap progress publicly using GitHub. While I'm in the Apple ecosystem, iCloud serves me quite well for cloud storage and syncing files between devices.

My files are entirely my own, so if any of these tools/services were to cease functioning, I could simply upload my files to the next tool of choice with minimal hassle.

For more on why I work this way, Steph Ango describes it fairly well [here](https://stephango.com/file-over-app).

## Why Public?

**Progress beats perfection. Default to action.** I fall into the perfectionism trap far too often. By defaulting to (public) action, I'm holding myself accountable while getting better at building in public.
