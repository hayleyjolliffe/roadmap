# 2025 Roadmap

This system is a living document designed to evolve as I progress through 2025. It contains my high-level goals for the year, and gets more granular with quarterly, monthly, weekly, and daily breakdowns and progress tracking. It also includes modular templates and all working documents associated with my life design plan.

This system is written in Markdown and structured to work seamlessly with my [daily stack](#stack), allowing for flexibility as it evolves.

## Purpose

- Align with my values and long-term goals
- Track progress across multiple areas of life and work
- Run focused quarters with clear priorities and systems
- Document my full process, ultimately what works and what doesn't
- Centralize planning for easier access within my personal ecosystem

## Stack
I prioritize file ownership wherever possible, and aim to mitigate dependence on proprietary technologies. More on this [here](https://stephango.com/file-over-app).

I aim to keep my tools simple and opinionated where possible. This particular project only uses [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and GitHub (including Projects and Pages).

While I'm in the Apple ecosystem, iCloud handles file-syncing between my devices fairly well.
